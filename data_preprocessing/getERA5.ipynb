    "# Download the Latest ERA5 Datasets Using the Climate Data Store (CDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most up-to-date meteorological data used for running the JULES model are sourced from the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels) via the **CDS API**. This ensures that the simulations are based on high-quality reanalysis datasets with a consistent temporal and spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meteorological Forcing Variables for JULES\n",
    "\n",
    "The following key meteorological forcing variables are required for running the **JULES** land surface model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tas**: Near-surface air temperature (2 meters above ground)\n",
    "- **tasrange**: Range between daily maximum and minimum temperature\n",
    "- **pr**: Total precipitation\n",
    "- **ps**: Surface pressure\n",
    "- **sfcWind**: Near-surface wind speed\n",
    "- **huss**: Near-surface specific humidity\n",
    "- **rsds**: Surface downwelling shortwave radiation\n",
    "- **rlds**: Surface downwelling longwave radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, 10 variables are retrieved from the **ERA5 single-level reanalysis** dataset at **hourly temporal resolution** and a horizontal resolution of **0.25° x 0.25°**. Some of these variables are used directly in the JULES model, meaninig that they only require  basic pre-processing, such as spatial aggregation and temporal remapping, to match the model's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculations and Derived Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables like tasrange, huss, hurs, and sfcwind had to be derived from other variables, as they are unavailable directly from ERA5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tasrange**: The difference between daily maximum temperature (**tasmax**) and daily minimum temperature (**tasmin**).\n",
    "- **huss** and **hurs**: Derived from near-surface dewpoint temperature (**dewptas**), surface pressure (**ps**), and near-surface air temperature (**tas**), using the equations described by **Buck (1981)** [[methodology](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Near+surface+meteorological+variables+from+1979+to+2019+derived+from+bias-corrected+reanalysis+%28WFDE5%29%3A+Product+User+Guide#Nearsurfacemeteorologicalvariablesfrom1979to2019derivedfrombiascorrectedreanalysis(WFDE5):ProductUserGuide-references9)]. \n",
    "- **sfcWind**: Calculated from the eastward (**uas**) and northward (**vas**) near-surface wind components, using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "sfcWind = \\sqrt{uas^2 + vas^2}\n",
    "\\]\n",
